1. Introduction
The Finance and Marketing Management System is a simple program developed using Object-Oriented Programming in C++. It demonstrates how OOP principles can be applied to real-world management tasks.
2. Objective
The main objective of this project is to manage financial and marketing data effectively and to demonstrate OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and classes.
3. System Overview
This project contains two main departments: Finance and Marketing. The Finance class handles revenue and expense data and calculates profit. The Marketing class manages campaign budgets and calculates average spending per campaign. Both classes inherit from a common base class, Department.
4. OOP Concepts Used
1. Classes and Objects: Represent real-world departments.
2. Inheritance: Finance and Marketing inherit from the Department base class.
3. Encapsulation: Data is kept private and accessed via member functions.
4. Abstraction: Complex logic like profit calculation is hidden from the user.
5. Code Explanation
The program starts by defining a base class called Department. Two derived classes, Finance and Marketing, inherit from it. The Finance class takes revenue and expense inputs from the user and calculates profit, while the Marketing class handles campaign count and total budget, calculating the average per campaign.
6. Output
The program displays a detailed report for both Finance and Marketing, including profit and budget distribution. It ensures user interaction and clear results.
7. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of Object-Oriented Programming in managing financial and marketing information. It emphasizes modularity, reusability, and clarity — core benefits of OOP.
